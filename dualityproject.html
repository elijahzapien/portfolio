    <h1>Duality Project</h1>
    <p>Created as my final project at California State University Long Beach for our senior show where we each created a piece inspired by one word chosen completely at random. That word was "metal".</p>
    <p>The Duality Project is a series of mini-sites depicting aspects of how metal has influenced humanity, and the dualities, positive and negative, associated with these topics.</p>
    <p>Privacy: There is no doubt technology has played a big role in how we communicate with the world. However with a world so technologicaly driven is there any real privacy anymore?</p>
